# POKEMON-GO: A NEW LANGUAGE FOR A NEW DECADE
wouldnt be scav without a 3am trainwash

## Prerequisites

It's highly recommended to install the latest version of the Go programming language in order to understand the advantages and improvements of Pokemon-Go; use `$ apt install golang-go` or your preferred package manager.

## Setup

1) Clone this repo: `$ git clone https://github.com/dgmorr/item085-macstrongin.git`

2) `cd` to the project directory. You should see the core executable file `pokemon-go` along with a directory of sample Pokemon-Go scripts that demonstrate the basic syntax of the language. Pokemon-Go scripts are identified with the `.pgo` extension.

## Usage

Run a Pokemon-Go script: `$ ./pokemon-go run path/to/myprogram.pgo`

Build a binary executable: `$ ./pokemon-go build path/to/myprogram.pgo`; this will output an executable called `myprogram` in the project root directory
